<h1 align="center">A simple MERN app with TwitchAPI</h1>

## Objective
Create a react app using TwitchAPI that allows users to:

1. Find a channel
2. Select the desired channel
3. View information about the selected channel
4. Restart the process

## Features

- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- Simple local React state management, using Context API.

## What's missing?

- Testing
- Comments
- Documentation
- Proper authentication
- Accessibility

Due to time constraints, these features and several others are missing from this project that would otherwise be present in a real-world project.
